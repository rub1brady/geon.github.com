## Reading: A Socio-physiological Outline*</I></h1>


The following pages can be nothing more than notes, a bringing together, more intuitive than organized, of scattered facts that allude only exceptionally to constituted bodies of knowledge. They belong rather to those ill-divided domains or fallow lands of descriptive ethnology once invoked by Marcel Mauss in an intro duction to the ‘techniques of the body’ and that, ranged under the heading of ‘miscellaneous’, constitute emergency zones of which all we know is that we don’t know very much, although we sense we might learn a great deal from them were we to tak e it into our heads to pay them some attention: banal facts, passed over in silence, no one’s responsibility, a matter of course. But even if we think we can get by without having to describe them, they describe us. They relate, with far more acuity and presence than most of the institutions and ideologies off which sociologists habitually feed, to the history of our bodies, to the culture that has shaped our gestures and our bodily postures, and to the education that has fashioned our motor functions at least as much as our mental acts. Mauss makes clear that this applies to walking and dancing, to running and jumping, to our modes of relaxation, to techniques of carrying and throwing, to our table manners and our manners in bed, to the external forms of respect, to bodily hygiene, etc. It applies also to reading.
Reading is an act and I wish to speak of this act and this act alone: of what constitutes it and what surrounds it; not of what it produces (the text, what we read), nor of what precedes it (writing and its choices, publishing and its choices, printing and its choices, distribution and its choices, etc.). In short, something like an economy of reading seen from an ergological (physiology, muscular effort) and socio-ecological perspective (its spatio-temporal setting).
For several decades now, a whole school of modern criticism has been laying stress on the lww of writing: on the doing of it, on its poetics. Not on its sacred maieutics, on taking inspiration by the throat, but the black on white, the texture of the text, the inscription, the trace, the letter taken literally, work at the micro level, the spatial organization of writing, its raw materials (pen or brush, the typewriter), its supports (Valmont to the Presidente de Tourvel in the Liaisons Dangereuses: ‘The very table on which I am writing to you, devoted to this use for the first time, becomes for me the sacred altar of love ... ‘), its codes (punctuation, paragraphing, monologues, etc.), its surroundings (the writer writing, his places, his rhythms; those who write in cafes, those who work at night, those who work at dawn, those who work on Sundays, etc.).
An equivalent study remains to be made, it seems to me, of the efferent aspect of this production: the taking in charge of the text by the reader. What we need to look at is not th e message once grasped but the actual grasping of the message at the elementary level: at what happens when we read, when the eyes settle on the lines and travel along them, and all that goes with this perusal. Which is to bring reading back to what it primarily is: a precise activity of the body, the bringing into play of certain muscles, different organizations of our posture, sequential decisions, tem poral choices, a whole set of strategies inserted into the continuum of social life which mean that we don’t read simp ly anyhow, any when and anywhere, even if we may read anything.


## 1. The Body

## The eyes

We read with the eyes. What the eyes do while we are reading is of such complexity as to exceed both my own competence and

1. Except for blind people, who read with the fingers. Except also for those who are being read to: in Russian nov els duchesses with their ladies in waiting, or Fren ch maiden ladies of good family ruined by the Revolution; or else, in the novels of Erckrnann-Chatrian, peasants who can’t read, gathered of an evening (big wooden table, bowls, pitchers, cats beside the hear th, dogs by the door) around one of them who is reading a letter from a son wounded in battle, the newspaper, the Bible or an almanac; or else again the grandparents of Maurice, whom Daudet called on while a young orphan girl was spelling out the life of St Irenee: ‘And im-med-iate-ly-two-li-ons-threw-them-sel-ves-on-him-and-de- vour-edhim.’

the scope of this article. From the abundant literature devoted to this question since the beginning of the century (Yarbus, Stark, etc.), we can at least derive one elementary but basic certainty: the eyes do not read the letters one after the other, nor the words one after the other, nor the lines one after the other, but proceed jerkily and by becoming fixed, exploring the whole reading field instantaneously with a stubborn redundancy. This unceasing perusal is punctuated by imperceptible halts as if, in order to discover what it is seeking, the eye needed to sweep across the page in an intensely agitated manner, not regularly, like a television receiver ( as the term ‘sweeping’ might lead one to think), but in a disorderly, repetitive and aleatory way; or, if you prefer, since we’re dealing in metaphors here, like a pigeon pecking at the ground in search of breadcrumbs. This image is a little suspect obviously, yet it seems to me characteristic, and I shan’t hesitate to take from it something that might serve as the point of departure for a theory of the text: to read is in the first instance to extract signifying elements from the text, to extract crumbs of meaning, something like key words, which we identify, compare and then find for a second time. It is by verifying that they are there that we know we are in the text, that we identify and authenticate it. These key words may be words (in detective novels, for example, and even more in erotic productions or what purport to be such), but they may also be sonorities (rhymes), page layouts, turns of phrase, typographical peculiarities (for example, the putting of too many words into italics in too many current works of fiction, criticism or critical fiction), or even whole narrative sequences.
We have to do here with something like what information theorists call formal recognition. The seeking out of certain perti nent characteristics enables us to pass from this linear sequence of characters, spaces and punctuation marks that the text first of all is to what will become its meaning once we have located, at the different stages of our reading, a syntactical coherence, a narrative organization and what is known as a ‘style’.
Aside from a few classic and elementary, i.e. lexical, examples (to read is to know straight off that the word see denotes either what we do when we open our eyes or else where you would expect to find a bishop), I don’t know by what protocols of experimentation it might be possible to study this work of recognition. For my own part I have only a negative confirmation of it: the intense feeling of frustration I have long been seized by when reading Russian novels ( ... Anna Mikhailovna Troubetskoy’s widower, Boris Timofeitch Ismailov, asked for the hand of Katerina Lvovna Borissitch, who preferred instead I van Mikhailov Vassiliev) or when, at the age of fifteen, I tried to decipher the reputedly risque passages in Diderot’s Les Bijoux indiscrets (‘Saepe turgentem spumantemque admovit ori priapum, simulque appressis ad labia labiis, fellatrice me lingua perfricuit ... ‘).
A certain art of the text might be based on the interplay between the predictable and the unpredictable, between expectation and disappointment, connivance and surprise. To come across subtly trivial or frankly slang expressions casually strewn through what is otherwise elegantly expressed might provide one example, rather as Roland Barthes describes at the start of Writing Degree Zero: ‘Hebert never began an issue of the Pere Duchene without putting in a few “fucks” and “buggers”. These crudenesses didn’t signify but they did signal.’
A certain art of reading — and not merely the reading of a text, but what is called ‘reading’ a picture, or a town — might consist of reading askance, of casting an oblique look at the text. (But this no longer has to do with reading at the physiological level: how could we teach our extra-ocular muscles to ‘read differently’?)<p>


## The voice, the lips

It is thought crude to move the lips when reading. We were taught to read by being made to read out loud; then we had to unlearn what we were told was a bad habit, no doubt because it smacks overmuch of application and of effort. Which doesn’t stop the cricoarytenoid and cricothyroid, the tensor and constrictor, muscles of the vocal cords and the glottis being activated when we read.
Reading remains inseparable from this labial mimeticism and its vocal activity — there are texts that should only be murmured or whispered, others that we ought to be able to shout or beat time to.<p>


## The hands

It’s not only the blind who are handicapped for reading; there are also the one-armed, who can’t turn the pages.
Turning the pages is all the hands are now used for. That books these days have almost always been trimmed robs readers of two great pleasures. One is that of cutting the pages (here, were I Laurence Sterne, there would be interpolated an entire chapter to the glory of the paper-knife, from the cardboard paper-knives given away by bookshops every time you bought a book, to paper-knives of bamboo, polished stone or steel, by way of paperknives shaped like a scimitar (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco), like a matador’s sword (Spain), like a samurai ‘s sabre (Japan), and of those ghastly objects sheathed in simulated leather which, together with various other objects of the same ilk (scissors, penholders, pencil boxes, universal calendars, handrests with built-in blotter, etc.) make up what is called a ‘desk set’). The other, even greater pleasure is that of starting to read a book without having cut the pages. You will recall (it’s not that far in the past after all) that books were folded in such a way that the pages needing to be cut alternated thus: eight pages of which you had to cut, first, the top edge, and then, twice over, the sides. The first eight pages could be read almost in their entirety without the paper-knife; of the other eight, you could obviously read the first and last and, if you lifted them up, the fourth and fifth. But that was all. There were gaps in the text which contained surprises and aroused expectations.

## Bodily posture

The posturology of reading is obviously too bound up with environmental conditions (which I shall look at in a moment) for it to be possible to envisage it as a subject in its own right. Yet it would be a fascinating topic for research, intrinsically linked to a sociology of the body that it might be thought surprising no sociologist or anthropologist has troubled to undertake (despite the project of Marcel Mauss’s that I mentioned at the start of this essay). In the absence of any systematic study I can only rough out a summary enumeration:

reading standing up (this is the best way of consulting a dictionary);
reading sitting down, but there are so many ways of sitting: feet touching the ground, feet higher than the seat, the body leaning backwards (armchair, settee), elbows propped on a table, etc.;
reading lying down; lying on the back; lying on the front; lying on the side, etc.;
reading kneeling (children looking through a picture book; the Japanese?);
reading squatting (Marcel Mauss: ‘The squatting position is, in my opinion, an interesting position that may be preserved in children. The greatest mistake is to deprive them of it. With the exception of our own societies, the whole of the human race has preserved it’);
reading walking; one thinks especially of the priest taking the fresh air while reading his breviary. But there is also the tourist strolling in a foreign town, street map in hand, or passing the pictures in a gallery while reading the descriptions of them given in the guide book. Or else walking in the countryside, book in hand, reading out loud. That seems to be becoming more and more uncommon.

## The Surroundings


‘I have always been the sort of person who enjoys reading. When I have nothing else to do, I read.’
Charlie Brown

One can, very roughly, distinguish between two categories of reading: reading accompanied by some other occupation (active or passive), and reading accompanied only by itself. The first kind is appropriate to a gentleman who is looking through a magazine while awaiting his turn at the dentist ‘s; the second kind to this same gentleman once he has returned home, at ease with his dentition, and is sitting at his table reading the Marquis de Moges’s Memoirs of an Ambassador in China.
There may come times, then, when we read for the sake of reading, when reading is our one activity of the moment. An example is given by readers sitting in the reading-room of a library; as it happens, a library is a special place set aside for reading, one of the only places where reading is a collective occupation. (Reading isn’t necessarily a solitary activity, but it is generally an individual activity. Two people may read together, temp le to temple, or one over the other’s shoulder; or we may reread out loud, for a few other people. But there is something a little surprising about the idea of several people reading the same thing at the same time: gentlemen in a club, reading The Times, a group of Chinese peasants studying the Little Red Book.)
Another example was, I thought, particularly well illustrated by a photograph that appeared a few years ago in L ‘Express on the occasion of a general feature on publishing in France: it showed Maurice Nadeau,(2) deep in a comfortable armchair, surrounded by piles of books higher than himself. Or else a child reading, or struggling to read, the chapter of natural history that he fears being questioned on the next day.
It wouldn’t be hard to multiply the examples. What seems to bind them together is that each time this ‘reading for the sake of reading ‘ is connected with the activity of studying, has something to do with work or a trade, with nec essity anyway. We need obviously to be more pr ecise and, in particular, to find more or less satisfactory criteria for distinguishing’ work from non-work. In the present state of things, it seems pertinent to point out this difference: on the one hand, a kind of reading, let’s call it professional, to which it is important to devote oneself entirely, to make it the sole objective of an hour or a whole day; on the other hand, a kind of reading, let’s call it recreational, which will always be accompanied by some other activity.
For the purpose that concerns me here, it is this indeed that most strikes me about the ways in which we read: not that reading should be considered a leisure activity, but that, generally speaking, it cannot exist on its own. It has to be inserted into some other necessity. Another activity has to support it. Reading is associated with the idea of having time to fill, of a lull we must take advantage of in order to read. Perhaps this supporting activity is only the pretext for reading, but how can we tell? Is a gentleman reading on the beach on the beach in order to read, or is he reading because he is on the beach ? Does the fragile destiny of Tristrarn Shandy really matter more to him than the sunburn he is busy getting on the backs of his legs? Would it not be right in any case to interrogate the environments in which we read? Reading isn ‘t merely to read a text, to decipher signs, to survey lines, to explore pages, to traverse a meaning; it isn ‘t merely the abstract communion between author and reader, the mystical marriage between the Idea and the Ear. It is, at the same time, the noise of the Metro, or the swaying of a railway compartment, or the heat of the sun on a beach and the shouts of the children playing a little way off, or the sensation of hot water in the bath, or the waiting for sleep ...
An example will enable me to clarify the object of this interrog ation - which you are quite within your rights, by the way, to find wholly otiose. A good ten years ago, I was dining with some friends in a small restaurant (hors d’oeuvres, plat du jour, cheese or dessert). At another table there was dining a philosopher who was already justly renowned. He was eat ing alone, while reading a cyclosty led text that was most likely a thesis. He read between courses and often even bet ween mouthfuls, and my companions and I wond ered ourselves wh at the effects of this double activity might be, what the mixture was like, what the words tasted of and what meaning the cheese had: one mouthful, one concept, one mouthful, one concept. How do you masti ca te a concep t, or ingurgitat e it, or digest it? And how could you give an account of the effect of this double nourishment, how describe or measure it?
The enumeration which follows is an outline typology of the situations in which we read; it doesn‘t answer merely to the pleasures of enumerating. I fancy it might prefigur e a global description of the activities that go on in towns today. Into the intricat e network of our daily rhythms are everywhere ins erted odd mom ents, scraps and intervals of reading time . It is as if, the imperati ves of the timet able having expell ed us from our own lives, we were remembering the days when, as chi ldren, we spent our Thursday afternoons sprawl ed on a bed in the company of the three musketeers or the children of Captain Grant, and reading had come to slide surreptitiously into the fissures and int erstices of our adult lives.


## Odd moments

Reading may be classifi ed according to th e time it takes up. Odd moments would come first. We read while we wait, at the barber ‘s or at the dentist ‘s (distractedl y, apprehensive as we are) ; when queueing outsid e the cinema, we read cinema programmes ; in administrative offices (socia l security, postal orders, lost property, etc.) waiting for our number to be call ed out . When they know they are going to have a long wait outside the entrance to the sports stadium or the Opera, th e provid ent equip themsel ves with a folding stool and a book.


## The Body

Reading may be classified according to bodily functions:
Food. Reading while eating (see above). Opening the mail, unfolding the newspaper, while having breakfast.
Washing. Reading in the bath is looked on by many as a supreme pleasure . Oft en, however, this is more agreeable in theory than in practice . Most bath-tubs turn out to be inconvenient and, lacking special equipment — book-rest, floating cusion, towels and taps within easy reach — and particular precautions, it’s no easier to read a book in the bath than it is, say, to smoke a cigarette. There is here a minor problem of every day life that desig1wn, would alu well to set themselves.
Bodily needs. Louis XIV held audiences sitting on his close stool. At the time this was quite normal. Our own societies have becom<· much more discreet. The bog remains, however, a privileged site for reading. Between th e gut as it relieves itself and the text a profound relationship is estab lished, something like an inte nse ava ilabi li ty, a heightened rece pti vity, read ing as happiness. o one, I fancy, has dealt better with this encounter between th e viscera an d the sensibilities than James Joyce:  

Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper turning its pages over on his bared knees. Something new and easy. o great hurry. Keep it a bit . Our pri ze titbit. Mat cham‘s Mast erstroke. Writt en by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers’ club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a colum n has been made to the writer. Thre e and a half. Three pounds three. Three pounds thirteen and six.
Quietly he read, restrain ing himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second. Mid way, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quie tly as he read, reading still patiently, that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone . Hope it’s not too big bring on piles again. o, just right. So. Ahl Costive one tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. (Ullysses)


## Sleep

We read a lot before going to sleep, and often in order to go to sleep, and even more when we can’t get to sleep. One great pleasure is to discover, in a house where you have been invited to spend the weekend, books that you haven’t read but have wanted to read, or familiar books you haven’t read for a long time. You carry a dozen of them off into your room, you read them, you reread them, until it’s almost morning.


## Social space

<p>We rarely read while working, except of course when our work consists of reading.
Mothers read in town squares while watching their children play. Loafers hang about round the second-hand book dealers along the quays, or go and read the daily papers posted up outside the editorial offices. Drinkers read their evening papers while having an aperitif on the terrace of a cafe.<p>


## Transport

We read a lot going to or coming back from our work. Reading may be classified according to the means of transport. Cars and coaches are no use (reading gives you a headache); buses are better suited, but have fewer readers than you might have expected, no doubt because of all there is to see in the street.
The place to read in is the Metro, almost by definition. I’m surprised that the Minister of Culture, or the Secretary of State for the universities has never yet exclaimed: ‘Stop demanding money for libraries, Messieurs. The true library of the people is the Metro!’ (thunderous applause from the majority benches).
From the reading point of view, the Metro offers two advantages. The first is that a journey by Metro lasts an almost perfectly determinate length of time (about one and a half minutes per station), which enables you to time your reading — two pages, five pages, a whole chapter — depending on the length of the journey. The second advantage is that your journey is repeated twice a day and five times a week, so that the book begun on Monday morning will be finished on Friday evening.


## Travelling

We read a lot when travelling. A special form of literature- known as station bookstall literature — is even set aside for it. We read above all in railway trains. In aeroplanes, we mainly look at magazines. Ships are becoming more and more rare. From the reading point of view, in any case, a ship is nothing more than a chaise longue (see below).

## Miscellaneous
Reading on holiday. Holidaymakers’ reading. Reading of those taking the cure. Tourist reading. Reading when ill at home, in hospital, when convalescing. Etc.  Throughout these pages, I have not concerned myself with what was being read, whether book or newspaper or leaflet. Simply with the fact that it was being read, in different places and at different times. What becomes of the text, what does it leave behind? How do we perceive a novel that is extended between Montgallet and Jacques-Bonsergent? How is this chopping-up of the text effected, when our taking charge of it is interfered with by our own bodies, by other people, by the time, by the din of the crowd? These are questions that I ask, and I think there is some point in a writer asking them.
